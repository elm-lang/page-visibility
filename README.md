# Page Visibility

This library helps you figure out if your app is visible at the moment. If the user is switched into a different tab, maybe you want to stop doing animations or pause a video.

This package is backed by the [JavaScript PageVisibility API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API).
